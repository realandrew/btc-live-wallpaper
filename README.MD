# Bitcoin Live Wallpaper

This is a wallpaper made for Wallpaper Engine, which displays the current price of Bitcoin (fetched from CoinGecko). You can find it on the Steam workshop [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2573360835).
It can also be used as a standard website in a browser, but the wallpaper engine properties will have to be manually adjusted (top of main.js).

## Roadmap

Note the wallpaper is currently very minimal. I want to maintain the minimal look, but add more featrues that can be toggled on via properties.
My first plan is to add support for other currencies. I will publish a more detailed roadmap soon.

## Contributing

This is a standard HTML5 stack project, so anyone who knows HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should be able to make contributions.
I plan to make a more detailed CONTRIBUTING.md in the future, but for the now the following guidelines apply:

* Problems should be reported via GitHub issues
* Features and changes may be discussed via GitHub issues
* Small features that can be toggled on and off via properties with no effects on other features can be submitted via pull request.
* Larger features or major changes to existing features should be discussed via a GitHub issue first.
* Small quality of life improvements to existing code and/or documentation is very welcome, and can be submitted via pull request.
